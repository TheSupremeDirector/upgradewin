# Instructions
You're going to want to install something like Virtualbox (https://www.virtualbox.org) which is a FREE virtual machine software, unless you want to do this on physical hardware. Make sure you enable virtualization in your computer's BIOS settings.

Our story begins with MS-DOS, or the Microsoft Disk Operating System. For this experiment we will be using MS-DOS 5.0, because the MS-DOS 6.X and above versions are incompatible with Windows 1.0. I found an apparently rare version of MS-DOS 5.0 that only uses one floppy disk. https://github.com/TheSupremeDirector/upgradewin/tree/main/MS-DOS

Next we have Windows 1.0X. I used the Windows 1.04 OEM for IBM. This is because it has native suport for both PS/2 and VGA. Insert disk01 into the floppy drive and run setup.exe. Make sure to select a PS/2 Mouse (option 7), and then Model 50, 60, 80 (option 2) for video settings. Swap disk01 for disk02. Select N when asked about a printer. Swap disk02 for disk03. The setup process should be very easy to follow. https://github.com/TheSupremeDirector/upgradewin/tree/main/WINDOWS-1.04-IBM-OEM
