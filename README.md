The classic upgrading Windows through all of it's versions experiment, simplified for you by TSD - This is all very Work-in-Progress

# Instructions
You're going to want to install something like Virtualbox (https://www.virtualbox.org) which is a FREE virtual machine software, unless you want to do this on physical hardware. Make sure you enable virtualization in your computer's BIOS settings.

Our story begins with MS-DOS, or the Microsoft Disk Operating System. For this experiment we will be using MS-DOS 5.0, because the MS-DOS 6.X and above versions are incompatible with Windows 1.0. I found an apparently rare version of MS-DOS 5.0 that only uses one floppy disk. https://github.com/TheSupremeDirector/upgradewin/tree/main/MS-DOS

Next we have Windows 1.0X. I used the Windows 1.04 OEM for IBM. This is because it has native suport for both PS/2 and VGA. Make sure to select a PS/2 Mouse (option 7), and then Model 50, 60, 80 (option 2). Select N when asked about a printer. https://github.com/TheSupremeDirector/upgradewin/tree/main/WIN-1.04

Following Windows 1.04 is Windows 2.03. During setup make sure you select IBM Personal System/2 Model 50, 60, 80 and that you skip setting up a printer. https://github.com/TheSupremeDirector/upgradewin/tree/main/WIN-2.03

Windows 3.0 will finally detect an existing Windows installation and upgrade it rather than completely overwriting it. Not only this, but it will also automatically detect your computer's hardware. However, you should still double-check that all of the settings are correct. We are greeted with a beautiful graphical installation screen upon floppy #2, where we once again skip setting up a printer. It is entirely up to you whether or not you want to import the old files from Windows 2.03 into Windows 3.0. https://github.com/TheSupremeDirector/upgradewin/tree/main/WIN-3.0
