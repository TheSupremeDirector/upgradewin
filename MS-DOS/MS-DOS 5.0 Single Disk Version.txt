MS-DOS 5.0 Single 1.44 MB Disk Version
Dated 11-11-1991

This is the same as the three disk version except the second two
disks are compressed into a .zip file and setup uses pkunzip.exe to
extract them to the harddrive.  This is a genuine Microsoft product
and not an aftermarket compilation.

This seems to be a rare and hard to find version.
